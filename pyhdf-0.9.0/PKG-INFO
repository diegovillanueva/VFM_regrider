Description: The pyhdf package wraps the functionality
         of the HDF version 4 library inside a Python OOP
         framework. The SD (scientific dataset), VS
         (Vdata) and V (Vgroup) APIs are currently implemented.
         SD datasets are read/written
         through numpy arrays. netCDF files can also
         be read and modified with pyhdf.
