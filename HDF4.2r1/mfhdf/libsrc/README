This is the source directory for the netcdf C language Library.

There is a simple test program, "cdftest",
which can be built to check the implementation.

A much more exhaustive test can be found in ../nctest.

Depending on the unkindness of your computer system vendor, you may
need to build the xdr routines in ../xdr first. Most modern unix systems
have the xdr routines aready in the C library.

Running cdftest should produce output like the contents of "testout.sav".
This program will also create a file called "test.cdf". This file should
be byte for byte the same as "test_cdf.sav".


Porting the netcdf code:

	If your compiler supports the "void *" type and you wish to 
   use this in the external interface, make sure that ncvoid is 
   properly defined at the top of "netcdf.h".

	If your compiler supports enums, "xdr_enum" works, and
   you wish to use enums in the external interface, make sure
   that USE_ENUM is defined at the top of "netcdf.h".

	If your compiler supports the "binary mode" option to
  fopen, as
	fp = fopen(filename, "w+b") ;
  be sure USE_BFLAG is defined near the top of "local_nc.h".
  This is especially important on PC's and the MacIntosh, since
  these systems will otherwise map bytes valued 0x0a ('\n') into
  two bytes 0x0d 0x0a ('\r''\n').

        Good Luck with the include files.


The following files are only used on VAX/VMS:
	descrip.mms - The immoral equivalent of a Makefile
	htons.mar - 'Host to Network Short', in VAX Macro
	ntohs.mar - 'Network to Host Short', in VAX Macro
