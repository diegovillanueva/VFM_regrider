VERSION		COMMENTS

 1.5.1 ?
               Added support for NeXTOS to autoconf macro UC_OS.

               Added script `which' and autoconf macro `UC_PROG_WHICH' to
               support platforms with no which(1) (e.g. UNICOS).

               Added recursive macros to master makefile to support, for
               example, command-line redefinition of CFLAGS.

               Fixed bug in UC_VERSION in setting minor version number.

               Fixed benign bug in UC_PREFIX that caused two identical
               definitions for `prefix' and `exec-prefix' in `config.status'.

               Added UC_MACHINE to determine machine hardware type.

1.5	1993-5-3
		Added support for Concurrent's (Masscomp's?) Real Time Unix
		(RTU) operating system.

		Made missing system header files be defined as `/dev/null'.

		Added default definition of NULL to stddef.h.in.

		Added support for `sigset_t', `sig_atomic_t', and `struct
		sigaction' and for sigfillset(), sigismember(), and
		sigpending(), and sigaction().

		Modified autoconf(1) support:
		    Made udposix.h independent of AC_CONFIG_HEADER().

		    Added capability for transforming any file via @...@
		    substitutions (not just makefiles).  This required a
		    slight change to autoconf(1)'s `acgeneral.m4'.

		    Made configure create POSIX header-files (e.g. stdlib.h),
		    allowing @...@ substitutions, and modified them
		    accordingly.

		Added full support for `size_t' in <stddef.h>, <stdlib.h>,
		<string.h>, and <time.h>.

		Added support for GNU info(1) pages.

		Added support for Data General's DGUX to fortc(1), UC_OS,
		and UC_PROG_FC.

1.4.1	1993-3-27
		Undid 1.4 modification because the library-build rule would
		fail on platforms where autoconf set RANLIB to `@:'.

		Quoted all define() first arguments in file `aclocal.m4' so
		that it can be read twice by m4(1) (useful because when 
		autoconf(1) is executed in this directory, it effectively
		reads `aclocal.m4' twice).

		Placed under CVS control.

		Corrected UC_CPP_X11 so that it won't generate `-I-I...'.

		Added test for OSF operating system.

		Added CPP_LDM and LD_LDM to missing values checklist.

1.4	1993-3-5

		Modified library creation rules so that nothing is done if
		LIBOBJS is empty.

1.3.4	1993-3-1

		Modified local autoconf(1) support file`aclocal.m4': added
		self-lockouts to UC_LIMITS and UC_FLOAT and UC_PROG_CC
		requirement.

		Modified method in master makefile, `master.mk.in', for
		producing .f file from .F file.  Now uses symbolic link to
		.c file.  Necessary because SunOS `acc -E' doesn't handle
		.F files and SunOS `cpp' gets wrong header files.

		Removed extraneous message about checking for <limits.h>
		from autoconf(1) macro-support file, aclocal.h.

1.3.3	1993-2-24

		Added modification of existing symbolic link to `ftp'
		target.

1.3.2	1993-2-23

		Changed rule for making a program in the master makefile.
		Now, the C compiler only uses $(CFLAGS) and the FORTRAN 
		compiler only uses $(FFLAGS): the $(LDFLAGS) reference has
		been removed.  This accomodates compilers that don't pass
		unknown options to the loader.

		Added `config' to `clean' target.

		Added `aclocal.m4' to MANIFEST so users can play with the
		autoconf(1)-generated configure script.

1.3.1	Tuesday, February 9, 1993

		Added dependency on library to `program' target.

1.3

		Changed `tar.Z' target: the top-level directory will now be
		the package name suffixed with the version number (e.g
		`udunits-1.5/README').

		Removed `configure' targets from Makefile.in and
		fortc/Makefile.in to comply with autoconf(1) 1.3.

1.2

		Added `SUBDIR_TARGETS = fortc/all' to Makefile.in so that
		it knows how to make `fortc/all'.

		Changed the way the operating-system is discovered from
		relying on file /etc/motd to testing for predefined C
		preprocessing macros.  This is more robust in the face of
		changes to the /etc/motd file at the expense of being less
		encompasing (I only know about the predefined macros of AIX,
		HPUX, IRIX, SunOS, and ULTRIX).

1.1.1

		Added HISTORY (this file) to the distribution.

		Changed procedure for discovering operating-system to use
		sed(1) rather than awk(1).

		Dropped the `lib' from `fortclib.{h,fc}'.

1.1

		Ported to HPUX.

1.0

		Initial release.  Tested on AIX, IRIX, SunOS, ULTRIX.
