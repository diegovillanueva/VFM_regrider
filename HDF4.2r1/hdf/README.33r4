In general, HDF 4.0 can be built with a single command from this 
directory.  The file Makefile is a generic, machine independent 
Makefile which you can modify if there is no Makefile already built 
for your machine.

For convenience, there are also machine customized makefiles.  For
example MAKE.IBM6000 is a Makefile suitable for compiling HDF
on an IBM RS/6000.

Assuming you are on an IBM RS/6000:

cp MAKE.IBM6000 Makefile

make    
make all 
        --- builds HDF library and the C and Fortran interfaces, the 
                utilities and C and Fortran test programs.

make allnofortran   
        --- builds the HDF library and only the C interfaces, the
                utilities and the C test programs.

make libdf
        --- builds the HDF library and the C and Fortran interfaces

make utilities
        --- builds only the utility programs

make tests
        --- builds all of the test programs
